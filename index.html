                    <p class="info">Lucknow Super Giants vs Delhi Capitals IPL 2024 Live Score: Rishabh Pant’s Delhi Capitals will be eager to get their campaign back on track when they will lock horns against KL Rahul’s Lucknow Super Giants at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow on Friday.

                        LSG, who sit on the third spot on the points table. Capitals on the other hand are languishing at the bottom of the points table with the worst net run rate of -1.370.
                        
                        Delhi Capitals has struggled to find the silver lining in their 2024 campaign barring skipper Rishabh Pant and Tristan Stubb’s form. The main issue is the team’s lack of depth in Indian talent on the bench. This deficiency does not instil confidence in the team</p>

                        <p class="info">
                            SpaceX’s Starship, the biggest and most powerful rocket in history, took off from the company’s Starbase facility in Boca Chica at 6.55 PM IST on Thursday. Unlike its previous two test flights, this time, the Elon Musk-led company’s mega-rocket did not explode, and it inserted the spacecraft into orbit. But after that, SpaceX confirmed that it lost the spacecraft.

The Starship rocket went farther than it did during the previous two flights but SpaceX said it lost communication with the spacecraft when it was reentering Earth’s atmosphere. It was supposed to splash down in the Indian Ocean but it most likely disintegrated or broke apart due to the stress of reentry.

But it would be wrong to think of the third test flight as a complete failure. It completed many mission objectives in a massive step forward for the spacecraft and launch system that Musk believes will take humanity to the Moon.

                        <p class="info">Starship’s development and delays in flight-readiness could have massive implications for human space exploration. NASA’s Artemis 3 mission, which is set to be the first to land astronauts on the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972, could be delayed if Starship is not ready in time.

                            The American space agency in 2021 selected SpaceX to develop the first commercial human lander that will carry astronauts to the lunar surface. The four astronauts who will be part of Artemis 3 will travel to the Moon in NASA’s Orion spacecraft launched by the agency’s Space Launch System (SLS). Those two systems have already been tested and validated during the Artemis 1 mission and will be tested again during Artemis 2, which will take astronauts on a journey to the Moon and back without landing.
                            
                            But after astronauts reach lunar orbit during the Artemis 3 mission, two of them will be transferred to a human landing system (HLS) variant of Starship, which will be tasked with taking the astronauts to the lunar surface and then bringing them back to orbit at the end of surface operations. After that, they will return to Orion where they will join their colleagues for a trip back home.</p>
